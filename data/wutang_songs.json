O corpo examinado\nSangue contaminado, vacinado, espantalho fabricado\nFotografado aclamado com o título de retró-grado\nNo recente, sente dó dos gados, a minha faca\nAlinha pra cortar tua placa, eliminar os traumas das almas mais fracas\nVocê saca essa idéia mas não saca uma pistola pruma pessoa inocente\nEu espero que nela 'cê não esvazie teu pente quente\nQuantas mentes com nós? Narinas inalam potentes pós\nEu termino esse meu verso que já voa igual um albatross\n\n[Verso 2: M.S.]\nO meu arquivo é... agressivo e nocivo\nSinônimo, antônimo, verbo e adjetivo\nConquistando igual Napoleão, não me acho normal\nEntrei no portal de Marte já por tal dos mártir\nJogo de palavra paraliza o teu raciocínio\nTemendo drive-by's, o meu parabrisa é de alumínio\nEu não durmo pois meus pesadelos\nAcordei surrando a parede e arrancando meus cabelos\nComo é que vocês vão reclamar do Kendrick Lamar?!\nEu vou gargalhar se o TEKASHI for me processar\nNão deixo ninguém me manipular nem me zoar no Brasil\nE também não sou do tipo de espalhar fake news\nMinha improvisação mais polarizado do que a eleição\nBons candidatos sofrem rejeição, ciclo eterno de ignorância\nPerfeição não, meu recipiente é crescente, quente\nNão tente 6 desejos pra estrela cadente, minha cadência\nVem rente com a paciência curta igual uma música ruim\nDo 50 Cent! Ele não tem, eu vou curar todos os seus filhos com asma\nE mesmo se eu morrer, vocês vão presenciar o meu fantasma!\nYou might also like[Verso 3: PAI DA RIMA]\nÉ isso mesmo, aqui Os Fracos Não Tem Vez\nAnton Chigurh vai capturar os corpos pra cada um de vocês\nPAI DA RIMA sobreviverá essa tempestade\nUma mentira contada várias vezes vai virar verdade\nA divindade da Eternidade, Presidente nunca aumentou\nA economia e põe a culpa na pandemia\nVocê carregar o peso mas colocar a culpa num outro irmão\nÉ que nem tirar o bife da boca do leão e dá pra hiena\nAnti-sistema, anarquista, invista que o sonho do menor\nEra ser o melhor artista! Mas aqui no Brasil só tem espaço pra futebol\nEntão o menor fica transtornado e brilha sua Glock no pôr-do-sol\nO Brasil produz muitos jogadores de futebol com seus valores\nMas a educação analfabeta escolar produz menos pensadores\nMinha metamorfose extinguiu a overdose, o nome disso é karma\nMuita gente morreu mas não foi culpa da arma\nSe é um louco sem noção armado, vai lá, irmão, e desarma!\nQuem tem coragem numa hora dessas é verdadeiramente um herói\nNão Hellboy, playboy se auto-destrói com arrogância\nE falta de relevância, também a pauta falta extravagância\nDa minha fragrância, você precisa manter distância, ela dá ânsia\nCansei dessa merda, vocês mentem quando me coroam como o rei\nEu menti, eu senti, MC?! Me aposentei!! Representei, presenteei!!1Embed",

My thing is, we as adults did not stand strong\nAnd on our square to bring our young people through this process. I know, I was the young person that had to fend for himself in the streets of New York. I know what happened, with our young people, I say, \"Look I ain't mad at you\", know no matter what I hear, I know that you are moving through a process because they are attempting to destroy the community so they're using you. They are buying you out. But we as adults, got to buy them back. I'm ready to compete with anybody for our young people's minds. And what we have to is change the paradigm of how we're interacting with them, deal with them from a heartfelt place where they can understand. You see because whether you realize it or not, it's you they're shooting in the streets. You, young brothers, they're the ones that are being shot. So with this entertainment or with this music, maybe I don't like what I hear, maybe that I don't like some of the words I hear, maybe that I don't like the direction, but I think they're doing a pretty good job considering that we, as men, the adult men, did not cover that when we should've covered that. And protected them when we should've protected them. And brought them up that so when we see an artist acting in a most inappropriate way, \"Where is the father in this?\", \"Where is that male mentor that can be there?\", We, as black men, must take on the responsibility as the honorable Elijah Muhammad told Malcolm is that a nation is only as strong as its weakest family. And we have got to create nations. We have to create relationships between the African man and the African woman that creates a viable nationSee Wu-Tang Clan LiveGet tickets as low as $22You might also likeEmbed",

You know, going to night school striving to get a diploma and transitioning to a legitimate lifestyle. That's what my life was like at that point when I met GZA. He mentioned he had family and brothers in Staten Island that were putting this movement together, this Wu-Tang thing. So one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. I didn't go because I had to go to night school that evening. So the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. And that tape was an unfinished version of \"Protect Yo Neck.\" When I heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. I never missed another studio session after that. Whenever he told me he was going somewhere I was there. It inspired me to sit down. Let me just see if I can write something. I've never written a rhyme before this. So that's what I did. I basically rehearsed that one rhyme, that one rhyme until I mastered it.  \n\n\"You remember the rhyme?\"  \n\nIt was the \"Mystery of Chessboxin'\" one.   See Wu-Tang Clan LiveGet tickets as low as $22You might also likeEmbed",

And it was like, they was, they was makin' a mark, and I kept hearin' the, the name and I knew, I knew somethin' was comin' with it, you could tell, you could just feel it.\n\nI remember bein' around Wu and I'm like, um, \"Damn, they just like us.\" You know what I'm sayin', the, the Raekwon remind me of this guy, Ghost remind me of this guy around my way. It was like cousins almost, it was like, you know, project kids. That's what it, that was the language, project kids. We felt it, we smelt it off each other, and it just shows you, out of those housing projects come some brilliant people.\n\nThe special thing about Wu-Tang bein' eight or nine guys was, each one was a rapper who could represent his own individual self within that crew. They were the example for all of us, 'cause we haven't, we didn't really see that before, like more power to them, and show love to them, respect them, you know. They're honorable. They gave us incredible skill. They gave us incredible poetry. And they gave us music that no one's touchin' to this day.

you wouldn't bust back\nI come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds\nAnd where I lounge is my stompin' grounds\nI give an order to my peeps across the water\nTo go and snatch up props all

goes\n[Verse 7: RZA]\nYo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that\nIt's ten o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?\nFeelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle\nFlowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel\nStroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style\nThe ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin\nTurn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin\nSlayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be\nComin' around the mountain when I come\nCrazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment\nMy clan increase like black unemployment\nYeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius\nTake us the fuck outta here\n\n[Verse 8: GZA]\nThe Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels\nSome ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel\nBe doin' artists in like Cain did Abel\nNow they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table\nThat's what you get when you misuse what I invent\nYour empire falls and you lose every cent\nFor tryna blow up a scrub\nNow that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb\nShould've pumped it when I rocked it\nNiggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets\nThis goes on in some companies\nWith majors, they're scared to death to pump these\nFirst of all, who's your A&R?\nA mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?\nBut he don't know the meanin' of dope\nWhen he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap\nThat's cleaner than a bar of soap\nAnd I'm the dirtiest thing in sight\nMatter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight\n\n[Outro: RZA]\nYou best protect ya neck\nYou best protect ya

holds swords\nAnd his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines\nWith more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains\nPoisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this\nYou get ambushed,

(Skit) Lyrics[Cheo Hodari Coker]\nThe first time I finally got with Wu, nobody really even knew what they looked like with the exception of, you know, that music video that I think they made for ten dollars for, for Method Man.\nBut the problem was the business of Wu-Tang. They missed the photoshoot. The only photos they had, I guess, featured them in masks. At the time, you know, this is pre-internet. If you missed the photoshoot, there was no way for a magazine to course correct. The magazine came out but instead of these photos, everybody had a basic, not even like an illustration, but a caricature. Raekwon the Chef, there was an illustration of Raekwon wearing, he's got like a chef hat. Ol' Dirty Bastard is pictured with a blow up doll. I didn't like 'em but the thing was was I completely understood the position that they were put in. Without art we would have to kill the story. I didn't think the illustrations reflected the seriousness of what I had witnessed. 'Cause musically Wu-Tang was just off the charts. I thought it looked corny. Some stories turn out great and some stories don't turn out great. This was the one I felt was only okay and um, you know, you move on. It came out and nothing happened, I didn't hear anything from the group.\nFirst person that I see, Masta Killa walks up. I didn't know him at the time. And he says, \"Yo, is you Cheo?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" Bam, I get hit in the face. He's right 'cross my left eye. \"That's just to let you know Wu-Tang Clan nothing to fuck with.
